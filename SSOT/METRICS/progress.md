## Active Items
- **Open Questions:** 8 (all P0)
- **Unclear Questions:** 0 (all questions are clear with targets and acceptance)
- **Open Audits:** 2 (A_006 MAJOR P0, A_008 MAJOR P1)
- **Linked Q↔A Pairs:** 8

## Top Priorities (by ROI)
1. **C03_MTAAgent (A_006)** - Privacy-critical contract drift; 2 linked P0 questions
2. **C10_FeatureStore (A_008)** - Observability gap impacting model accuracy; 2 linked P0 questions
3. **C07_DataIngestion** - Idempotency/security gaps; 2 linked P0 questions
4. **C01_IdentityResolution (A_002)** - GDPR compliance execution; 1 linked P0 question
5. **C02_MMMAgent (A_003)** - Model validation improvement; 1 linked P0 question

## Next Phase
- **Expected:** PROMPT_ENGINEER
- **Focus:** Synthesize NEXT_STEPS from capsule items A_006, A_008, and linked questions
- **Budget:** ≤3 product files per EXECUTE round
