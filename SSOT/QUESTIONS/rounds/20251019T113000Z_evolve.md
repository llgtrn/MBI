## Capsule Integration Notes
All 50 questions are capsule-ready with:
- ✅ Concise title (question field)
- ✅ Short why_it_matters (≤200 chars)
- ✅ Single-sentence acceptance_signal
- ✅ ≤3 evidence_anchor targets
- ✅ Urgency tagged (P0/P1)

- ✅ Cross-references to prior questions where relevant
- ✅ Focus on gaps in Red components and Yellow observability needs

## Priority Focus Areas
1. **Data integrity & reconciliation:** Revenue variance, late events, schema evolution (Q_503, Q_505, Q_530, Q_531)
2. **Risk gates & validation:** MMM/MTA divergence, holdout validation, activation rate limits (Q_506, Q_538, Q_539)
3. **Compliance & governance:** GDPR deletion, cross-border transfer, audit retention (Q_527, Q_529, Q_543)
4. **Execution safety:** Creative rotation race, playbook DAG cycles, budget convergence (Q_510, Q_534, Q_509)
5. **Observability gaps:** C01/C02/C03/C04 Yellow components need metrics/traces/runbooks (Q_512, Q_520, Q_521)
